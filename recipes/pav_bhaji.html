    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pav bhaji, Paw bhaji or Pao bhaji (Marathi : पाव भाजी pāʋ bhājī) is a main course staple food of Mumbai, India consisting of a thick spicy vegetable curry (bhaji) served with a soft buttered bread roll (pav). It originated in the city of Mumbai, Maharashtra</p>
    <p>Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) and serve the dish hot. A soft white bread roll is the usual accompaniment to the curry, but this does not preclude the use of other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread. </p>
